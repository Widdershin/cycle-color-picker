TODO:
- abstract shared functions
- refactor to send payload objects
- work out the storing of hue -- * / / by 360 when and where.


-----------------------------------------------------------

get things to return literally just the sub-value
handle state only in the parent
pass it down


- BUGS
  - Things shit up when you resize -- I could add a listener for window resize events that will calculate the stuff again
